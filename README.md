# RSSFF

THIS IS A WIP
Expect Nothing great. Its doesn't work as intended and there is a lot of work going towards it

Used to view and auto collect movies for torrent. Using customizeable RSS feeds from your favorite sites. With keywords to look out for, It'll auto save movies from their title and store them to collect later. Using a separate script it'll also show you all your previously downloaded films for a movie database all in one place.
